Getting started with Android App Dev.

The first project that i have made is a simple StopWatch. It has three main buttons "Start","Stop" and "Reset" .
The start button will start the stopwatch. Stop button will stop the stopwatch and Reset button will take take stopwatch back to it's initial state.


There are two more projects about which I shall be updating soon.
1) The CatChat
